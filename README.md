Blocknet
=====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/blocknetdx/blocknet.svg?branch=4.0.0)](https://travis-ci.org/blocknetdx/blocknet)

https://blocknet.org

Welcome to the Blocknet repository. This repo is for the Blocknet Protocol, a 2nd layer blockchain interoperability protocol that enables communication, interaction, and exchange between different blockchains. This allows for the development of multi-chain applications and blockchain microservices, creating exponentially more capabilities and possibilities for the blockchain ecosystem.

[Contributors are welcome!](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blocknet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

#### Contribution Workflow Summary (applies to all blocknetdx repos)
1. push or merge pull_request to dev branch. This builds debug artifacts.
1. after testing/debugging debug artifacts, create an appropriately named tag starting with a "v" for the latest commit in the dev branch. (Use semantic versioning https://semver.org/). pushing or merging this tag builds and publishes a release with optimized binaries which can then be tested by the community. The tag can be created on the Github website, or it can be created from the CLI on a local clone of the repo something like this:

	```shell
	# switch branch to 'dev'
	git checkout dev

	# ensure we have the latest changes from the remote branch
	git pull

	# create a new tag
	git tag v4.4.1-rc.2

	# push the tag to github (triggers build/publish)
	git push -u origin v4.4.1-rc.2
	```

1. Community/testers test release. If issues are found and iterations through the above steps are required, increment the last digit of the tag on each iteration (e.g. v4.4.1-rc.2, v4.4.1-rc.3, v4.4.1-rc.4, etc...)
1. When all testing is complete, merge the dev branch to the master/main branch, then create an appropriately named tag starting with a "v" for the latest commit in the master/main branch. This builds and publishes the final release binaries. In the case of blocknet core, it additionally creates docker images (the "latest" tag is assigned automatically, if a version tag located on the default branch is pushed). The tag can be created on the Github website, or it can be created from the CLI on a local clone of the repo something like this:

	```shell
	# switch branch to 'master'
	git checkout master

	# ensure we have the latest changes from the remote branch
	git pull

	# create a new tag
	git tag v4.4.1

	# push the tag to github (triggers build/publish)
	git push -u origin v4.4.1
	```
1. **never:** rename or delete an existing tag or release, that will create a huge mess

Blocknet
-------

Started in 2014, [Blocknet](https://docs.blocknet.org/project/introduction) is a decentralized, community-governed, self-funded, open-source project that serves as a connector between different blockchains, markets, and communities. 

The Blocknet Protocol
-------

The Blocknet Protocol enables decentralized communication and exchange between different blockchains in a permissionless and trustless manner through the use of the TCP/IP networking layer for communication, P2P atomic swaps using BIP65 for exchange, and a DHT overlay network ([Service Nodes](https://docs.blocknet.org/service-nodes/introduction)) to host the full nodes of compatible blockchains, host microservices, audit interactions, and perform anti-spam and anti-DOS measures for the network. 

Block DX
-------

[Block DX](https://docs.blocknet.org/blockdx/introduction) is a completely decentralized and trustless exchange built on the Blocknet Protocol that mimics a centralized exchange experience and enables traders to conduct exchanges directly from the wallets of the coins being traded.

Decentralized Atomic Swap Algo Summary
-------

```Step1.
Initiator creates secret X, and hashes it to create H(X). Initiator also creates public private key pair (pubkey i1,i2 / privkey i2,i2). Responder creates public private key pair (pubkey r1,r2 / privkey r1,r2).

Step 2.
Initiator shares H(X) and pubkey i2 with responder. Responder shares pubkey r1 with intiator.

Step 3.
Initiator creates TxAb. TxAb can be redeemed after time T2 with privkey i1. At any time TxAb can redeemed with signature from privkey r1 and reveal of secret X. Initiator broadcasts TxAb onto the network.

Step 4.
Responder confirms TxAb. Responder creates TxBb. TxBb can be redeemed after T1 time with privkey r2. At any time TxBb can be redeemed with signature fom privkey i2 and reveal of secret X. Responder broadcasts TxBb onto the network.

Step 5.
Initiator creates TxBp which spends TxBb using privkey i2 and secret X. With the revealed secret, responder can create TxAp which spends TxAb with privkey r1 and secret X.
```

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is stable and will match the latest release. Development 
branches are indicated by the version number and may or may not be stable.
[Tags](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blocknet/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Blocknet.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
